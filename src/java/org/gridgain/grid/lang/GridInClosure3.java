/**
 * Defines a convenient {@code one-way} closure, i.e. the closure that has {@code void} return type.
 * Since Java 6 doesn't provide a language construct for first-class function the closures are
 * implemented as interfaces.
 * <h2 class="header">Type Alias</h2>
 * To provide for more terse code you can use a typedef {@link org.gridgain.grid.typedef.CI3} class or various factory methods in
 * {@link GridFunc} class. Note, however, that since typedefs in Java rely on inheritance you should
 * not use these type aliases in signatures.
 * <h2 class="header">Thread Safety</h2>
 * Note that this interface does not impose or assume any specific thread-safety by its
 * implementations. Each implementation can elect what type of thread-safety it provides,
 * if any.
