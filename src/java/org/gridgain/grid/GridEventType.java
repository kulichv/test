/**
 * Contains event type constants. The decision to use class and not enumeration
 * dictated by allowing users to create their own events and/or event types which
 * would be impossible with enumerations.
 * <p>
 * Note that this interface defines not only
 * individual type constants but arrays of types as well to be conveniently used with
 * {@link Grid#addLocalEventListener(GridLocalEventListener, int...)} method:

 * NOTE: all types in range <b>from 1 to 1000 are reserved</b> for
 * internal GridGain events and should not be used by user-defined events.
 * <h1 class="header">Events and Performance</h1>
 * Note that by default all events in GridGain are enabled and therefore generated and stored
 * by whatever event storage SPI is configured. GridGain can and often does generate thousands events per seconds
 * under the load and therefore it creates a significant additional load on the system. If these events are
 * not needed by the application this load is unnecessary and leads to significant performance degradation.
 * <p>
 * It is <b>highly recommended</b> to enable only those events that your application logic requires
 * by using either  {@link GridConfiguration#getExcludeEventTypes()} or
 * {@link GridConfiguration#getIncludeEventTypes()} methods in GridGain configuration. Note that certain
 * events are required for GridGain's internal operations and such events will still be generated but not stored by
 * event storage SPI if they are disabled in GridGain configuration.
