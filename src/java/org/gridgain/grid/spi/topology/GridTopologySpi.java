/**
 * Topology SPI allows developer to have a custom logic deciding what specific set of
 * grid nodes (topology) is available to GridGain in any given point of time. This SPI is
 * called every time before grid task gets mapped ({@link GridTask#map(List, Object)}).
 * <p>
 * Implementations can employ various strategies, e.g., some may be time based when certain nodes
 * are available only at certain time or dates, or topology can be based on average load of
 * the nodes, or it can be based on specifics of the task obtained from the task session
 * and ability to match them to grid nodes.
 * <p>
 * Note that in simple environments the topology is often the same as entire grid (sometimes
 * minus the local node). More complex topology management is required only when available
 * topology changes per task or per some other condition.
 * <p>
 * GridGain comes with following implementations:
 * <ul>
 *      <li>
 *          {@link  GridBasicTopologySpi} -
 *          based on configuration returns either all,
 *          only local, or only remote nodes. This one is a default implementation.
 *      </li>
 *      <li>
 *          {@link GridAttributesTopologySpi} -
 *          based on attributes set.
 *          Those nodes that have attributes with the same values will be included.
 *      </li>
 *      <li>
 *          {@link GridNodeFilterTopologySpi} -
 *          based on predicate node filter.
 *          Those nodes that pass predicate filter will be included.
 *      </li>
 * </ul>
