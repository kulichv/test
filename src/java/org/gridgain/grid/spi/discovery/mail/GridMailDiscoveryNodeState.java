/**
 * Remote node state from local one point of view. Being started remote node has {@link #NEW} state.
 * Than after receiving attributes by request remote node gets status {@link #READY}.
 * When remote node is leaving grid it sends corresponded message and its state
 * is changed to {@link #LEFT}. Another way which node could move to {@link #LEFT}
 * state is just stop sending heartbeat requests and local node will change remote
 * one state to {@link #LEFT}.
