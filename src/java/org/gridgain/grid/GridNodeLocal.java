 * Defines interface for node-local storage.

 * Node-local values are similar to thread locals in a way that these values are not
 * distributed and kept only on local node (similar like thread local values are attached to the
 * current thread only). Node-local values are used primarily by closures executed from the remote
 * nodes to keep intermediate state on the local node between executions.
 * <p>
 * Currently, this interface simply extends {@link ConcurrentMap} and serves as a future
 * extension point.
