/**
 * Defines a "rich" node as a single node-based grid projection.
 * <p>
 * All main grid entities such as grid, projection, cloud and a node instances can be viewed as
 * collection of grid nodes (in case of the grid node this collection consist of only one
 * element). As such they all share the same set of operations that can be performed on a set
 * grid nodes. These operations are defined in {@link GridProjection} interface and called
 * <tt>monadic</tt> as they are equally defined on any arbitrary set of nodes.
 * <h2 class="header">Thread Safety</h2>
 * Implementation of this interface provides necessary thread synchronization.
 * <h2 class="header">Nullable and Monads</h2>
 * Many methods in this interface accepts nullable parameters. Although it may seem counter intuitive
 * for some of them - it is done to promote monadic usage of this interface. Java doesn't support
 * natively concepts like <tt>Option</tt> in Scala and returning, accepting, and properly handling
 * {@code null} values is Java's way to support such monadic invocations.
 * <p>
 * All methods that accept {@code null} values (for monadic purposes) will gracefully handle it by
 * either returning a finished future, or empty collection, {@code null} value, or combination of the
 * above. Most method calls therefore can be chained without an explicit checks for {@code null}s.
 * <p>
 * The downside of this approach that inadvertent errors of passing {@code null} will not result
 * in {@link NullPointerException} and may be harder to catch.

     * Convenient shortcut that executes given jobs on this node and reduces their results.
     * This method simply delegates to {@link #reduce(GridClosureCallMode, Collection, GridReducer, GridPredicate[])}.
     * <p>
     * This method will block until its execution is complete or an exception is thrown.
     * All default SPI implementations configured for this grid instance will be
     * used (i.e. failover, load balancing, collision resolution, etc.).
     * Note that if you need greater control on any aspects of Java code execution on the grid
     * you should implement {@link GridTask} which will provide you with full control over the execution.
     * <p>
     * Here's a general example of the Java method that takes a text message and calculates its length
     * by splitting it by spaces, calculating the length of each word on individual (remote) grid node
     * and then summing (reducing) results from all nodes to produce the final length of the input string
     * using function APIs, typedefs, and execution closures on the grid:
     * <pre name="code" class="java">
     * public static int length(final String msg) throws GridException {
     *     return G.grid().reduce(SPREAD,
     *         F.yield(
     *             msg.split(" "),

     *                 &#64;Override public Integer apply(String e) { return e.length(); }

     * Note that class {@link GridAbsClosure} implements {@link Runnable} and class {@link GridOutClosure}
     * implements {@link Callable} interface. Note also that class {@link GridFunc} and typedefs provide rich
     * APIs and functionality for closures and predicates based processing in GridGain. While Java interfaces
     * {@link Runnable} and {@link Callable} allow for lowest common denominator for APIs - it is advisable
     * to use richer Functional Programming support provided by GridGain available in {@link org.gridgain.grid.lang}
     * package.
     * <p>
     * Notice that {@link Runnable} and {@link Callable} implementations must support serialization as required
     * by the configured marshaller. For example, JDK marshaller will require that implementations would
     * be serializable. Other marshallers, e.g. JBoss marshaller, may not have this limitation. Please consult
     * with specific marshaller implementation for the details. Note that all closures and predicates in
     * {@link org.gridgain.grid.lang} package are serializable and can be freely used in the distributed
     * context with all marshallers currently shipped with GridGain.
