/**
 * This interface provides a rich API for working with individual cache entries. It
 * includes the following main functionality:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 *  Various {@code 'get(..)'} methods to synchronously or asynchronously get values from cache.
 *  All {@code 'get(..)'} methods are transactional and will participate in an ongoing transaction
 *  if there is one.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *  Various {@code 'set(..)'}, {@code 'setIfAbsent(..)'}, and {@code 'replace(..)'} methods to
 *  synchronously or asynchronously put single or multiple entries into cache.
 *  All these methods are transactional and will participate in an ongoing transaction
 *  if there is one.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *  Various {@code 'remove(..)'} methods to synchronously or asynchronously remove single or multiple keys
 *  from cache. All {@code 'remove(..)'} methods are transactional and will participate in an ongoing transaction
 *  if there is one.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *  Various {@code 'invalidate(..)'} methods to set cached values to {@code null}.
 * <li>
 * <li>
 *  Various {@code 'isLocked(..)'} methods to check on distributed locks on a single or multiple keys
 *  in cache. All locking methods are not transactional and will not enlist keys into ongoing transaction,
 *  if any.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *  Various {@code 'peek(..)'} methods to peek at values in global or transactional memory, swap
 *  storage, or persistent storage.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *  Various {@code 'reload(..)'} methods to reload latest values from persistent storage.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *  Method {@link #evict(GridPredicate[])} to evict elements from cache, and optionally store
 *  them in underlying swap storage for later access. All {@code 'evict(..)'} methods are not
 *  transactional and will not enlist evicted keys into ongoing transaction, if any.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *  Methods for {@link #timeToLive(long)} to change or lookup entry's time to live. 
 * </ul>
 * <h1 class="header">Extended Put And Remove Methods</h1>
 * All methods that end with {@code 'x'} provide the same functionality as their sibling
 * methods that don't end with {@code 'x'}, however instead of returning a previous value they
 * return a {@code boolean} flag indicating whether operation succeeded or not. Returning
 * a previous value may involve a network trip or a persistent store lookup and should be
 * avoided whenever not needed.
 * <h1 class="header">Predicate Filters</h1>
 * All filters passed into methods on this API are checked <b>atomically</b>. In other words the
 * value returned by the methods is guaranteed to be consistent with the filters passed in.
 * <h1 class="header">Transactions</h1>
 * Cache API supports distributed transactions. All {@code 'get(..)'}, {@code 'put(..)'}, {@code 'replace(..)'},
 * and {@code 'remove(..)'} operations are transactional and will participate in an ongoing transaction,
 * if any. Other methods like {@code 'peek(..)'} may
 * be transaction-aware, i.e. check in-transaction entries first, but will not affect the current
 * state of transaction. See {@link GridCacheTx} documentation for more information
 * about transactions.
 * <h1 class="header">Null Keys or Values</h1>
 * Neither {@code null} keys or values are allowed to be stored in cache. If a {@code null} value
 * happens to be in cache (e.g. after invalidation or remove), then cache will treat this case
 * as there is no value at all.
 * <p>
 * All API method with {@link Nullable @Nullable} annotation on method parameters
 * or return values either accept or may return a {@code null} value. Parameters that do not
 * have this annotation cannot be {@code null} and invoking method with a {@code null} parameter
 * in this case will result in {@link NullPointerException}.
 * <h1 class="header">Peer Class Loading</h1>
 * All classes passed into cache API will be automatically deployed to any participating grid nodes.
 * No explicit deployment step is required.
