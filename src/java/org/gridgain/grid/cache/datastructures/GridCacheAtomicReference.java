/**
 * This interface provides a rich API for working with distributed atomic reference.
 * <p>
 * Note that atomic reference is only available in <b>Enterprise Edition.</b>
 * <p>
 * <h1 class="header">Functionality</h1>
 * Distributed atomic reference includes the following main functionality:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * Method {@link #get()} synchronously gets current value of an atomic reference.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Method {@link #set(Object)} synchronously and unconditionally sets the value in the an atomic reference.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Methods {@code compareAndSet(...)} synchronously and conditionally set the value in the an atomic reference.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * All previously described methods have asynchronous analogs.
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * Method {@link #name()} gets name of atomic reference.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <h1 class="header">Creating Distributed Atomic Reference</h1>
 * Instance of distributed atomic reference can be created by calling one of the following methods:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link GridCache#atomicReference(String)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link GridCache#atomicReference(String, Object, boolean)}</li>
 * </ul>
