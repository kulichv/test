/**
 * This interface provides a rich API for working with Data Grid-based distributed queue.
 * <p>
 * Note that queue is only available in <b>Enterprise Edition</b>.
 * <p>
 * <h1 class="header">Functionality</h1>
 * Cache queue provides an access to cache elements using typical queue API. Cache queue also implements
 * {@link Collection} interface.
 * <p>
 * Note that all {@link Collection} methods in the queue can throw {@link GridRuntimeException}.
 * <p>
 * Queue can be unbounded or bounded. Capacity of queue can be set when queue will be created and can't be
 * changed later. Here is an example of how create bounded {@code LIFO} queue with capacity of 1000 items
 * {@link GridCache#queue(String, GridCacheQueueType, int)}
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * GridCacheQueue&lt;String&gt; queue = cache().queue("anyName", LIFO, 1000);
 * ...
 * queue.add("item");
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Queue provides different access to queue elements:
 * <ul>
 *      <li>{@link GridCacheQueueType#FIFO} (default)</li>
 *      <li>{@link GridCacheQueueType#LIFO}</li>
 *      <li>{@link GridCacheQueueType#PRIORITY}</li>
 * </ul>
 * For more information about types of queue refer to {@link GridCacheQueueType} documentation.
 * <p>
 * Priority queue provides sorting queue items by priority.
 * Priority in the queue item can be set using annotation {@link GridCacheQueuePriority}.
 * Only one field or method can be annotated in queue item class.
 * Annotated field must be {@code int} or {@code Integer} and annotated method must
 * return {@code int} or {@code Integer} result.
 * Here is an example of how annotate queue item:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * private static class PriorityMethodItem {
 *       // Priority field.
 *       private final int priority;
 *
 *       private PriorityMethodItem(int priority) {
 *           this.priority = priority;
 *       }
 *
 *       // Annotated priority method.
 *       &#64;GridCacheQueuePriority
 *       int priority() {
 *           return priority;
 *       }
 *   }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Queue items can be placed on one node or distributed through grid nodes (governed by the cache that
 * created that queue).
 * Distributed mode provides only for partitioned cache and it is configured via {@code collocated} parameter.
 * If {@code collocated} is {@code true} all queue items will be placed on one node, else items will be distributed
 * through all grid nodes.
 * <p>
 * Here is an example of how create unbounded {@link GridCacheQueueType#PRIORITY} queue with items
 * distributed through grid topology.
 * {@link GridCache#queue(String, GridCacheQueueType, int)}
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * GridCacheQueue&lt;String&gt; queue = cache().queue("anyName", PRIORITY, Integer.MAX_VALUE, false);
 * ...
 * queue.add("item");
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Distributed Cache Queue provides implementation for:
 * <ul>
 *      <li>blocking,</li>
 *      <li>non-blocking,</li>
 *      <li>and asynchronous operations.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <h1 class="header">Creating Distributed Cache Queue</h1>
 * Instance of distributed cache queue can be created by calling one of the following methods:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link GridCache#queue(String)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link GridCache#queue(String, GridCacheQueueType)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link GridCache#queue(String, GridCacheQueueType, int)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link GridCache#queue(String, GridCacheQueueType, int, boolean)}</li>
 * </ul>
