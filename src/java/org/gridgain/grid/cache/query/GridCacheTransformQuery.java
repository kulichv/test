/**
 * Cache query with possible remote transformer. The execution sequence is
 * essentially identical to the one described in {@link GridCacheQuery} javadoc,
 * except that queried values are given to an optional transformer
 * directly on the queried node which should usually transform cached values into
 * smaller and more light-weight objects to return to caller. This technique allows
 * to save on network trips whenever only a subset of data from cached values needs
 * to be returned.
 * <h1 class="header">Transform Query Usage</h1>
 * Here is a query example which returns only employee names to the caller instead
 * of returning full {@code 'Person'} objects with lots of extra data.
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * GridCache&lt;Long, Person&gt; cache = G.grid().cache();
 * ...
 * // Create query to get names of all employees working for some company.
 * GridCacheTransformQuery&lt;UUID, Person, String&gt; qry =
 *   cache.createTransformQuery(SQL, Person.class,
 *     "from Person, Organization where Person.orgId = Organization.id and lower(Organization.name) = lower(?)");
 *
 * // Transformer to convert Person objects to String.
 * // Since caller only needs employee names, we only
 * // send names back.
 * qry.remoteTransformer(new CO&lt;GridClosure&lt;Person, String&gt;&gt;() {
 *     &#64;Override public GridClosure&lt;Person, String&gt; apply() {
 *         return new C1&lt;Person, String&gt;() {
 *             &#64;Override public String apply(Person person) {
 *                 return person.getName();
 *             }
 *         };
 *     }
 * });
 *
 * // Query all nodes for names of all GridGain employees.
 * Collection&lt;String&gt; gridgainEmployeeNames = qry.with("GridGain").execute(G.grid()).get());
 * </pre>
