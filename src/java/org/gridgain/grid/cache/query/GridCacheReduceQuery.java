/**
 * Cache query with possible remote and local reducers. The execution sequence is
 * essentially identical to the one described in {@link GridCacheQuery} javadoc,
 * except that queried key-value pairs are given to an optional reducer
 * directly on the queried node and a single reduced value is returned back
 * to caller node. Then on the caller node, the collection of reduced values
 * is given to optionally provided local reducer. Based on whether local
 * reducer is provided or not, either a single value or a collection of
 * reduced values is returned to user.
 * <h1 class="header">Reduce Query Usage</h1>
 * Here is a query example which calculates average salary for all cached employees of
 * any given company based on the same example data mode described in {@link GridCacheQuery}
 * documentation.
