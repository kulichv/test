/**
 * This interface provides a rich API for working with distributed caches. It includes the following
 * main functionality:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 *  Various {@code 'get(..)'} methods to synchronously or asynchronously get values from cache.
 *  All {@code 'get(..)'} methods are transactional and will participate in an ongoing transaction
 *  if there is one.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *  Various {@code 'put(..)'}, {@code 'putIfAbsent(..)'}, and {@code 'replace(..)'} methods to
 *  synchronously or asynchronously put single or multiple entries into cache.
 *  All these methods are transactional and will participate in an ongoing transaction
 *  if there is one.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *  Various {@code 'remove(..)'} methods to synchronously or asynchronously remove single or multiple keys
 *  from cache. All {@code 'remove(..)'} methods are transactional and will participate in an ongoing transaction
 *  if there is one.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *  Various {@code 'contains(..)'} method to check if cache contains certain keys or values.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *  Various {@code 'forEach(..)'}, {@code 'forAny(..)'}, and {@code 'reduce(..)'} methods to visit
 *  every cache entry within this projection.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *  Various {@code flagsOn(..)'}, {@code 'flagsOff(..)'}, and {@code 'projection(..)'} methods to
 *  set specific flags and filters on a cache projection.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *  Methods like {@code 'keySet(..)'}, {@code 'values(..)'}, and {@code 'entrySet(..)'} to provide
 *  views on cache keys, values, and entries.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *  Various {@code 'peek(..)'} methods to peek at values in global or transactional memory, swap
 *  storage, or persistent storage.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *  Various {@code 'reload(..)'} methods to reload latest values from persistent storage.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *  Various {@code 'unswap(..)'} methods to load specified keys from swap storage into
 *  global cache memory.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *  Various {@code 'invalidate(..)'} methods to set cached values to {@code null}.
 * <li>
 *  Various {@code 'lock(..)'}, {@code 'unlock(..)'}, and {@code 'isLocked(..)'} methods to acquire, release,
 *  and check on distributed locks on a single or multiple keys in cache. All locking methods
 *  are not transactional and will not enlist keys into ongoing transaction, if any.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *  Various {@code 'clear(..)'} methods to clear elements from cache, and optionally from
 *  swap storage. All {@code 'clear(..)'} methods are not transactional and will not enlist cleared
 *  keys into ongoing transaction, if any.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *  Various {@code 'evict(..)'} methods to evict elements from cache, and optionally store
 *  them in underlying swap storage for later access. All {@code 'evict(..)'} methods are not
 *  transactional and will not enlist evicted keys into ongoing transaction, if any.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *  Various {@code 'txStart(..)'} and {@code 'inTx(..)'} methods to perform various cache
 *  operations within a transaction (see {@link GridCacheTx} for more information).
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *  Various {@code 'createXxxQuery(..)'} methods to query cache using either {@link GridCacheQueryType#SQL SQL},
 *  {@link GridCacheQueryType#LUCENE LUCENE} or {@link GridCacheQueryType#H2TEXT H2TEXT} text search, or
 *  {@link GridCacheQueryType#SCAN SCAN} for filter-based full scan (see {@link GridCacheQuery}
 *   for more information).
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *  Various {@code 'mapKeysToNodes(..)'} methods which provide node affinity mapping for
 *  given keys. All {@code 'mapKeysToNodes(..)'} methods are not transactional and will not enlist
 *  keys into ongoing transaction.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *  Various {@code 'gridProjection(..)'} methods which provide {@link GridProjection} only
 *  for nodes on which given keys reside. All {@code 'gridProjection(..)'} methods are not
 *  transactional and will not enlist keys into ongoing transaction.
 * </li>
 * <li>Method {@link #toMap()} to convert this interface into standard Java {@link ConcurrentMap} interface.
 * </ul>
 * <h1 class="header">Extended Put And Remove Methods</h1>
 * All methods that end with {@code 'x'} provide the same functionality as their sibling
 * methods that don't end with {@code 'x'}, however instead of returning a previous value they
 * return a {@code boolean} flag indicating whether operation succeeded or not. Returning
 * a previous value may involve a network trip or a persistent store lookup and should be
 * avoided whenever not needed.
 * <h1 class="header">Predicate Filters</h1>
 * All filters passed into methods on this API are checked <b>atomically</b>. In other words the
 * value returned by the methods is guaranteed to be consistent with the filters passed in. Note
 * that filters are optional, and if not passed in, then methods will still work as is without
 * filter validation.
 * <h1 class="header">Transactions</h1>
 * Cache API supports distributed transactions. All {@code 'get(..)'}, {@code 'put(..)'}, {@code 'replace(..)'},
 * and {@code 'remove(..)'} operations are transactional and will participate in an ongoing transaction,
 * if any. Other methods like {@code 'peek(..)'} or various {@code 'contains(..)'} methods may
 * be transaction-aware, i.e. check in-transaction entries first, but will not affect the current
 * state of transaction. See {@link GridCacheTx} documentation for more information
 * about transactions.
 * <h1 class="header">Null Keys or Values</h1>
 * Neither {@code null} keys or values are allowed to be stored in cache. If a {@code null} value
 * happens to be in cache (e.g. after invalidation or remove), then cache will treat this case
 * as there is no value at all.
 * <p>
 * All API method with {@link Nullable @Nullable} annotation on method parameters
 * or return values either accept or may return a {@code null} value. Parameters that do not
 * have this annotation cannot be {@code null} and invoking method with a {@code null} parameter
 * in this case will result in {@link NullPointerException}.
 * <h1 class="header">Peer Class Loading</h1>
 * All classes passed into cache API will be automatically deployed to any participating grid nodes.
 * No explicit deployment step is required.
