/**
 * <img id="callout_img" src="{@docRoot}/img/callout_blue.gif"><span id="callout_blue">Start Here</span>&nbsp;
 * Main <b>Data Grid</b> APIs.
 * <h1 class="header">Rich API</h1>
 * This API extends {@link GridCacheProjection} API which contains vast majority of cache functionality
 * and documentation. In addition to {@link GridCacheProjection} functionality this API provides:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 *  Various {@code 'loadCache(..)'} methods to load cache either synchronously or asynchronously.
 *  These methods don't specify any keys to load, and leave it to the underlying storage to load cache
 *  data based on the optionally passed in arguments.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *  Methods like {@code 'tx{Un}Synchronize(..)'} witch allow to get notifications for transaction state changes.
 *  This feature is very useful when integrating cache transactions with some other in-house transactions.
 * </li>
 * </li>
 * <li>Method {@link #metrics()} to provide metrics for the whole cache.</li>
 * <li>Method {@link #configuration()} to provide cache configuration bean.</li>
 * <li>Method {@link #randomEntry()} to retrieve random entry from cache.</li>
 * <li>Method {@link #overflowSize()} to get the size of the swap storage.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <h1 class="header">Named Data Structures</h1>
 * Cache provides some types of named structures such as {@link GridCacheAtomicLong},
 * {@link GridCacheAtomicReference}, {@link GridCacheAtomicStamped}, and {@link GridCacheAtomicSequence}.
 * All instances of these structures must have unique names in cache regardless of their type.
 * <h1 class="header">Null Keys or Values</h1>
 * Neither {@code null} keys or values are allowed to be stored in cache. If a {@code null} value
 * happens to be in cache (e.g. after invalidation or remove), then cache will treat this case
 * as there is no value at all.
 * <p>
 * All API method with {@link Nullable @Nullable} annotation on method parameters
 * or return values either accept or may return a {@code null} value. Parameters that do not
 * have this annotation cannot be {@code null} and invoking method with a {@code null} parameter
 * in this case will result in {@link NullPointerException}.
 * <h1 class="header">Allowed Discovery SPIs</h1>
 * When working with distributed cache, proper node ordering is required on startup. For that
 * reason cache can be used only with implementations of {@link org.gridgain.grid.spi.discovery.GridDiscoverySpi}
 * that are annotated with {@link org.gridgain.grid.spi.discovery.GridDiscoverySpiOrderSupport} annotation.
 * User can also relax this annotation and can manually ensure that nodes are started sequentially (not concurrently).
 * To do that, {@link GridSystemProperties#GG_NO_DISCO_ORDER} must be provided at startup.
