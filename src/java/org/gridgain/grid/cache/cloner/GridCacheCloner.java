/**
 * Cache cloner which clones cached values before returning them from cache.
 * It will only be used if {@link GridCacheFlag#CLONE} flag is set
 * on projection which the user is working with (this flag is disabled
 * by default).
 * <p>
 * This behaviour is useful, as a an example, when we need to get some object
 * from cache, change some of its properties and put it back into cache.
 * In such a scenario it would be wrong to change properties of cached value
 * itself without creating a copy first, since it would break cache integrity,
 * and will affect the cached values returned to other threads even before
 * the transaction commits.
 * <p>
 * Cache cloner can be set in cache configuration via {@link GridCacheConfiguration#getCloner()}
 * method. By default, cache uses {@link GridCacheBasicCloner} implementation
 * which will clone only objects implementing {@link Cloneable} interface. You
 * can also configure cache to use {@link GridCacheDeepCloner} which will perform
 * deep-cloning of all objects returned from cache, regardless of the
 * {@link Cloneable} interface. If none of the above cloners fit your logic, you
 * can also provide your own implementation of this interface.
