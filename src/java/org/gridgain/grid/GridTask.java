/**
 * Grid task interface defines a task that can be executed on the grid. Grid task
 * is responsible for splitting business logic into multiple grid jobs, receiving
 * results from individual grid jobs executing on remote nodes, and reducing
 * (aggregating) received jobs' results into final grid task result.
 * <p>
 * <h1 class="header">Grid Task Execution Sequence</h1>
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 *      Upon request to execute a grid task with given task name system will find
 *      deployed task with given name. Task needs to be deployed prior to execution
 *      (see {@link Grid#deployTask(Class)} method), however if task does not specify
 *      its name explicitly via {@link GridTaskName @GridTaskName} annotation, it
 *      will be auto-deployed first time it gets executed.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *      System will create new distributed task session (see {@link GridTaskSession}).
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *      System will inject all annotated resources (including task session) into grid task instance.
 *      See <a href="http://www.gridgain.com/javadoc/org/gridgain/grid/resources/package-summary.html">org.gridgain.grid.resources</a>
 *      package for the list of injectable resources.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *      System will apply {@link #map(List, Object) map(List, Object)}. This
 *      method is responsible for splitting business logic of grid task into
 *      multiple grid jobs (units of execution) and mapping them to
 *      grid nodes. Method {@link #map(List, Object) map(List, Object)} returns
 *      a map of with grid jobs as keys and grid node as values.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *      System will send mapped grid jobs to their respective nodes.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *      Upon arrival on the remote node a grid job will be handled by collision SPI
 *      (see {@link GridCollisionSpi}) which will determine how a job will be executed
 *      on the remote node (immediately, buffered or canceled).
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *      Once job execution results become available method {@link #result(GridJobResult, List) result(GridJobResult, List)}
 *      will be called for each received job result. The policy returned by this method will
 *      determine the way task reacts to every job result:
 *      <ul>
 *      <li>
 *          If {@link GridJobResultPolicy#WAIT} policy is returned, task will continue to wait
 *          for other job results. If this result is the last job result, then
 *          {@link #reduce(List) reduce(List)} method will be called.
 *      </li>
 *      <li>
 *          If {@link GridJobResultPolicy#REDUCE} policy is returned, then method
 *          {@link #reduce(List) reduce(List)} will be called right away without waiting for
 *          other jobs' completion (all remaining jobs will receive a cancel request).
 *      </li>
 *      <li>
 *          If {@link GridJobResultPolicy#FAILOVER} policy is returned, then job will
 *          be failed over to another node for execution. The node to which job will get
 *          failed over is decided by {@link GridFailoverSpi} SPI implementation.
 *          Note that if you use {@link GridTaskAdapter} adapter for {@code GridTask}
 *          implementation, then it will automatically fail jobs to another node for 2
 *          known failure cases:
 *          <ul>
 *          <li>
 *              Job has failed due to node crash. In this case {@link GridJobResult#getException()}
 *              method will return an instance of {@link GridTopologyException} exception.
 *          </li>
 *          <li>
 *              Job execution was rejected, i.e. remote node has cancelled job before it got
 *              a chance to execute, while it still was on the waiting list. In this case
 *              {@link GridJobResult#getException()} method will return an instance of
 *              {@link GridExecutionRejectedException} exception.
 *          </li>
 *          </ul>
 *      </li>
 *      </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *      Once all results are received or {@link #result(GridJobResult, List) result(GridJobResult, List)}
 *      method returned {@link GridJobResultPolicy#REDUCE} policy, method {@link #reduce(List) reduce(List)}
 *      is called to aggregate received results into one final result. Once this method is finished the
 *      execution of the grid task is complete. This result will be returned to the user through
 *      {@link GridTaskFuture#get()} method.
 * </li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * <h1 class="header">Resource Injection</h1>
 * Grid task implementation can be injected using IoC (dependency injection) with
 * grid resources. Both, field and method based injection are supported.
 * The following grid resources can be injected:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link GridTaskSessionResource}</li>
 * <li>{@link GridInstanceResource}</li>
 * <li>{@link GridLoggerResource}</li>
 * <li>{@link GridHomeResource}</li>
 * <li>{@link GridExecutorServiceResource}</li>
 * <li>{@link GridLocalNodeIdResource}</li>
 * <li>{@link GridMBeanServerResource}</li>
 * <li>{@link GridMarshallerResource}</li>
 * <li>{@link GridSpringApplicationContextResource}</li>
 * <li>{@link GridSpringResource}</li>
 * </ul>
 * Refer to corresponding resource documentation for more information.
 * <p>
 * <h1 class="header">Grid Task Adapters</h1>
 * {@code GridTask} comes with several convenience adapters to make the usage easier:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * {@link GridTaskAdapter} provides default implementation for {@link GridTask#result(GridJobResult, List)}
 * method which provides automatic fail-over to another node if remote job has failed
 * due to node crash (detected by {@link GridTopologyException} exception) or due to job
 * execution rejection (detected by {@link GridExecutionRejectedException} exception).
 * Here is an example of how a you would implement your task using {@link GridTaskAdapter}:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * public class MyFooBarTask extends GridTaskAdapter&lt;String, String&gt; {
 *     // Inject load balancer.
 *     &#64;GridLoadBalancerResource
 *     GridLoadBalancer balancer;
 *
 *     // Map jobs to grid nodes.
 *     public Map&lt;? extends GridJob, GridNode&gt; map(List&lt;GridNode&gt; subgrid, String arg) throws GridException {
 *         Map&lt;MyFooBarJob, GridNode&gt; jobs = new HashMap&lt;MyFooBarJob, GridNode&gt;(subgrid.size());
 *
 *         // In more complex cases, you can actually do
 *         // more complicated assignments of jobs to nodes.
 *         for (int i = 0; i &lt; subgrid.size(); i++) {
 *             // Pick the next best balanced node for the job.
 *             jobs.put(new MyFooBarJob(arg), balancer.getBalancedNode())
 *         }
 *
 *         return jobs;
 *     }
 *
 *     // Aggregate results into one compound result.
 *     public String reduce(List&lt;GridJobResult&gt; results) throws GridException {
 *         // For the purpose of this example we simply
 *         // concatenate string representation of every
 *         // job result
 *         StringBuilder buf = new StringBuilder();
 *
 *         for (GridJobResult res : results) {
 *             // Append string representation of result
 *             // returned by every job.
 *             buf.append(res.getData().string());
 *         }
 *
 *         return buf.string();
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * {@link GridTaskSplitAdapter} hides the job-to-node mapping logic from
 * user and provides convenient {@link GridTaskSplitAdapter#split(int, Object)}
 * method for splitting task into sub-jobs in homogeneous environments.
 * Here is an example of how you would implement your task using {@link GridTaskSplitAdapter}:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * public class MyFooBarTask extends GridTaskSplitAdapter&lt;Object, String&gt; {
 *     &#64;Override
 *     protected Collection&lt;? extends GridJob&gt; split(int gridSize, Object arg) throws GridException {
 *         List&lt;MyFooBarJob&gt; jobs = new ArrayList&lt;MyFooBarJob&gt;(gridSize);
 *
 *         for (int i = 0; i &lt; gridSize; i++) {
 *             jobs.add(new MyFooBarJob(arg));
 *         }
 *
 *         // Node assignment via load balancer
 *         // happens automatically.
 *         return jobs;
 *     }
 *
 *     // Aggregate results into one compound result.
 *     public String reduce(List&lt;GridJobResult&gt; results) throws GridException {
 *         // For the purpose of this example we simply
 *         // concatenate string representation of every
 *         // job result
 *         StringBuilder buf = new StringBuilder();
 *
 *         for (GridJobResult res : results) {
 *             // Append string representation of result
 *             // returned by every job.
 *             buf.append(res.getData().string());
 *         }
 *
 *         return buf.string();
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * Refer to corresponding adapter documentation for more information.
