/**
 * Cloud resource defines any type of manageable resource on the cloud.
 * <p>
 * In GridGain a cloud is defined as a collection of resources where all resources
 * in the cloud form a set of undirected graphs. Cloud resource defines any manageable resource in
 * the specific cloud such as image, instance, profile, network attached storage, block device,
 * etc. Each resource has a collection of adjacent resources returned by {@link #links()}
 * method. Note that links are bi-directional, i.e. if node {@code A} has a link to node {@code B},
 * node {@code B} always has link back to {@code A} for any two adjacent nodes {@code A} and {@code B}
 * in the resource graph.
 * <p>
 * Note that this interface does not impose any parent-child or directional relationships on its
 * collection of resources - although they exist in every specific case. In fact, the every cloud provider
 * not only will have potentially different set of resources and/or resource types, but the parent-child
 * relationship can be different as well. {@link GridRichCloud} interface provide convenient methods for
 * navigating cloud resources graphs.
 * <p>
 * Cloud SPI is responsible for producing the cloud snapshot that includes cloud resource
 * graphs.
