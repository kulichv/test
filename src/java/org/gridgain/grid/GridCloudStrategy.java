/**
 * Defines cloud strategy for automated cloud management.
 * Cloud strategy is user defined class whose lifecycle is managed by
 * GridGain distributed runtime, i.e. strategies will be activated and
 * deactivated automatically by GridGain.
 * <p>
 * Cloud strategy is effectively a simple callback mechanism that is
 * managed by GridGain. Interface has no methods and inherits activation and
 * deactivation semantic.
 * <p>
 * Note that like cloud policies the strategies are activated only
 * on the cloud coordinator node. In other words, for any given cloud
 * there is only one strategy instance that is active in the topology.
 * <p>
 * Note also that policies should be configured on all nodes
 * that can be a cloud coordinator. If node's configuration excludes it
 * from being a coordinator (see {@link GridConfiguration#isDisableCloudCoordinator()})
 * policies can be omitted from the configuration.
