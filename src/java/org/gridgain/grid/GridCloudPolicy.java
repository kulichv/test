/**
 * Defines pluggable SLA/QoS control for execution of cloud commands.
 * Cloud policy is user defined class whose lifecycle is managed by
 * GridGain distributed runtime, i.e. policies will be activated and
 * deactivated automatically by GridGain.
 * <p>
 * When user issues a cloud command the GridGain implementation will
 * first run this command against all registered cloud policies. If
 * all policies accept this command then it will be passed to cloud
 * SPI for the execution.
 * <p>
 * Note that like cloud strategies the policies are activated only
 * on the cloud coordinator node. In other words, for any given cloud
 * there is only one policy instance that is active in the topology.
 * <p>
 * Note also that policies should be configured on all nodes
 * that can be a cloud coordinator. If node's configuration excludes it
 * from being a coordinator (see {@link GridConfiguration#isDisableCloudCoordinator()})
 * policies can be omitted from the configuration.
