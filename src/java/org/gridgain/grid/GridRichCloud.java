/**
 * Defines a "rich" cloud as a cloud-based grid projection.
 * <p>
 * All main grid entities such as grid, projection, cloud and a node instances can be viewed as
 * collection of grid nodes (in case of the grid node this collection consist of only one
 * element). As such they all share the same set of operations that can be performed on a set
 * grid nodes. These operations are defined in {@link GridProjection} interface and called
 * <tt>monadic</tt> as they are equally defined on any arbitrary set of nodes.
 * <h2 class="header">Thread Safety</h2>
 * Implementation of this interface provides necessary thread synchronization.
 * <h2 class="header">Nullable and Monads</h2>
 * Many methods in this interface accepts nullable parameters. Although it may seem counter intuitive
 * for some of them - it is done to promote monadic usage of this interface. Java doesn't support
 * natively concepts like <tt>Option</tt> in Scala and returning, accepting, and properly handling
 * {@code null} values is Java's way to support such monadic invocations.
 * <p>
 * All methods that accept {@code null} values (for monadic purposes) will gracefully handle it by
 * either returning a finished future, or empty collection, {@code null} value, or combination of the
 * above. Most method calls therefore can be chained without an explicit checks for {@code null}s.
 * <p>
 * The downside of this approach that inadvertent errors of passing {@code null} will not result
 * in {@link NullPointerException} and may be harder to catch.

     * To deal with this inherently non-deterministic nature of cloud operations GridGain relies
