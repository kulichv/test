/**
 * Interface representing a single grid node. Use {@link #getAttribute(String)} or
 * {@link #getMetrics()} to get static and dynamic information about remote nodes.
 * {@code GridNode} list, which includes all nodes within task topology, is provided
 * to {@link GridTask#map(List, Object)} method. You can also get a handle on
 * discovered nodes by calling any of the following methods:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link Grid#localNode()}</li>
 * <li>{@link Grid#remoteNodes(org.gridgain.grid.lang.GridPredicate[])}</li>
 * <li>{@link Grid#nodes(org.gridgain.grid.lang.GridPredicate[])}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <h1 class="header">Grid Node Attributes</h1>
 * You can use grid node attributes to provide static information about a node.
 * This information is initialized once within grid, during node startup, and
 * remains the same throughout the lifetime of a node. Use
 * {@link GridConfiguration#getUserAttributes()} method to initialize your custom
 * node attributes at startup. For example, to provide benchmark data about
 * every node from Spring XML configuration file, you would do the following:
 * <pre name="code" class="xml">
 * &lt;bean id="grid.cfg" class="org.gridgain.grid.GridConfigurationAdapter" scope="singleton">
 *     ...
 *     &lt;property name="userAttributes">
 *         &lt;map>
 *             &lt;entry key="grid.node.benchmark">
 *                 &lt;bean class="org.gridgain.grid.benchmarks.GridLocalNodeBenchmark" init-method="start"/>
 *             &lt;/entry>
 *         &lt;/map>
 *     &lt;/property>
 *     ...
 * &lt;/bean&gt;
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * The system adds the following attributes automatically:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code {@link System#getProperties()}} - All system properties.</li>
 * <li>{@code {@link System#getenv(String)}} - All environment properties.</li>
 * <li>{@code org.gridgain.build.ver} - GridGain build version.</li>
 * <li>{@code org.gridgain.jit.name} - Name of JIT compiler used.</li>
 * <li>{@code org.gridgain.net.itf.name} - Name of network interface.</li>
 * <li>{@code org.gridgain.user.name} - Operating system user name.</li>
 * <li>{@code org.gridgain.grid.name} - Grid name (see {@link Grid#getName()}).</li>
 * <li>
 *      {@code spiName.org.gridgain.spi.class} - SPI implementation class for every SPI,
 *      where {@code spiName} is the name of the SPI (see {@link GridSpi#getName()}.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *      {@code spiName.org.gridgain.spi.ver} - SPI version for every SPI,
 *      where {@code spiName} is the name of the SPI (see {@link GridSpi#getName()}.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Note that all System and Environment properties for all nodes are automatically included
 * into node attributes. This gives you an ability to get any information specified
 * in {@link System#getProperties()} about any node. So for example, in order to print out
 * information about Operating System for all nodes you would do the following:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * for (GridNode node : G.grid().nodes()) {
 *     System.out.println("Operating system name: " + node.getAttribute("os.name"));
 *     System.out.println("Operating system architecture: " + node.getAttribute("os.arch"));
 *     System.out.println("Operating system version: " + node.getAttribute("os.version"));
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * This interface provide a system view on the node instance. All user-level APIs work with
 * {@link GridRichNode} interface that provides much more functionality and extends this
 * interface. Consult {@link GridRichNode} for more information.
 * <p>
 * <h1 class="header">Grid Node Metrics</h1>
 * Grid node metrics (see {@link #getMetrics()}) are updated frequently for all nodes
 * and can be used to get dynamic information about a node. The frequency of update
 * is often directly related to the heartbeat exchange between nodes. So if, for example,
 * default {@link GridMulticastDiscoverySpi} is used,
 * the metrics data will be updated every {@code 3} seconds by default.
 * <p>
 * Grid node metrics provide information about other nodes that can frequently change,
 * such as Heap and Non-Heap memory utilization, CPU load, number of active and waiting
 * grid jobs, etc... This information can become useful during job collision resolution or
 * {@link GridTask#map(List, Object)} operation when jobs are assigned to remote nodes
 * for execution. For example, you can only pick nodes that don't have any jobs waiting
 * to be executed.
 * <p>
 * Local node metrics are registered as {@code MBean} and can be accessed from
 * any JMX management console. The simplest way is to use standard {@code jconsole}
 * that comes with JDK as it also provides ability to view any node parameter
 * as a graph.
