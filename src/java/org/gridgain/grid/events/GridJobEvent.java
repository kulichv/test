/**
 * Grid job event.
 * <p>
 * Grid events are used for notification about what happens within the grid. Note that by
 * design GridGain keeps all events generated on the local node locally and it provides
 * APIs for performing a distributed queries across multiple nodes:
 * <ul>
 *      <li>
 *          {@link Grid#remoteEvents(org.gridgain.grid.lang.GridPredicate , long, org.gridgain.grid.lang.GridPredicate[])} -
 *          querying events occurred on the nodes specified, including remote nodes.
 *      </li>
 *      <li>
 *          {@link Grid#remoteEventsAsync(org.gridgain.grid.lang.GridPredicate , long, org.gridgain.grid.lang.GridPredicate[])} -
 *          asynchronously querying events occurred on the nodes specified, including remote nodes.
 *      </li>
 *      <li>
 *          {@link Grid#localEvents(org.gridgain.grid.lang.GridPredicate[])} -
 *          querying only local events stored on this local node.
 *      </li>
 *      <li>
 *          {@link Grid#addLocalEventListener(GridLocalEventListener , int...)} -
 *          listening to local grid events (events from remote nodes not included).
 *      </li>
 * </ul>
 * User can also wait for events using the following two methods:
 * <ul>
 *      <li>{@link Grid#waitForEventAsync(org.gridgain.grid.lang.GridPredicate , int...)}</li>
 *      <li>{@link Grid#waitForEvent(long, Runnable, org.gridgain.grid.lang.GridPredicate , int...)}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <h1 class="header">Events and Performance</h1>
 * Note that by default all events in GridGain are enabled and therefore generated and stored
 * by whatever event storage SPI is configured. GridGain can and often does generate thousands events per seconds
 * under the load and therefore it creates a significant additional load on the system. If these events are
 * not needed by the application this load is unnecessary and leads to significant performance degradation.
 * <p>
 * It is <b>highly recommended</b> to enable only those events that your application logic requires
 * by using either  {@link GridConfiguration#getExcludeEventTypes()} or
 * {@link GridConfiguration#getIncludeEventTypes()} methods in GridGain configuration. Note that certain
 * events are required for GridGain's internal operations and such events will still be generated but not stored by
 * event storage SPI if they are disabled in GridGain configuration.
