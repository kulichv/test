 * originating node to the cloud coordinator where they are executed by specific cloud SPI.
 * <p>
 * It is important to note that only <b>specific cloud SPI defines</b> what commands are supported.
 * You need to consult specific cloud SPI documentation to see what specific commands are supported
 * and what parameters, if any, are expected.

     * Gets command ID.
     * <p>
     * Giving cloud command a proper ID is <i>essential for filtering out duplicate commands</i> sent
     * from the different grid nodes. GridGain internally maintains a topology version for each cloud.
     * Whenever cloud changes (new instance, new instance parameters, etc) its topology version
     * is changing too. When a node responsible for coordinating cloud operations ("cloud coordinator")
     * receives cloud command it first checks if command with the same ID was already sent for execution
     * for the current cloud version. If it was - all further commands with this ID will be ignored until
     * the version of the cloud is changed.
     * <p>
     * Note that it is impossible to avert all logical duplication of cloud controls. Since cloud commands
     * could be issued simultaneously by multiple nodes some of them may arrive after the cloud topology
     * changed as the result of the previously processed command - even with the same ID. In this situation
     * even though remote nodes reacted to the same condition to issue their commands - full duplicate
     * prevention is impossible in general. It is highly advisable that application cloud control logic
     * should be designed in a such a way that it can compensate for the "extra" produced by duplicate command
     * execution.
     * <p>
     * The simplest way to come up with command ID is to <i>name</i> the place in your code that issues
     * the cloud command. Often combination of class name and method name is ideal command ID (unless you
     * have multiple cloud commands in the same method).
     * <p>
     * Note also that you should not confuse this command ID with command execution ID returned from
     * {@code invoke(...)} methods on {@link GridRichCloud} interface.
     * Execution ID will always be unique for each execution (even of the same command). Both command
     * ID and execution ID are available through {@link org.gridgain.grid.events.GridCloudEvent}.
