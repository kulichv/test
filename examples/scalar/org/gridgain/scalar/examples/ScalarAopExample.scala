/**
 * Demonstrates a simple use of GridGain grid in Scala with `Gridify`
 * annotation. 
 * <p>
 * String "Hello, World!" is passed as an argument to
 * `sayOnSomeNode(String)` method. Since this method is annotated with
 * `Gridify` annotation it is automatically grid-enabled and
 * will be executed on remote node. Note, that the only thing user had
 * to do is annotate method `sayOnSomeNode(String)` with {@link Gridify}
 * annotation, everything else is taken care of by the system.
 * <p>
 * <h1 class="header">Starting Remote Nodes</h1>
 * To try this example you should (but don't have to) start remote grid instances.
 * You can start as many as you like by executing the following script:
 * <pre class="snippet">{GRIDGAIN_HOME}/bin/ggstart.{bat|sh}</pre>
 * Once remote instances are started, you can execute this example from
 * Eclipse, Idea, or NetBeans (or any other IDE) by simply hitting run
 * button. You will witness that all nodes discover each other and
 * some of the nodes will participate in task execution (check node
 * output).
 * <p>
 * <h1 class="header">AOP Configuration</h1>
 * In order for this example to execute on the grid, any of the following
 * AOP configurations must be provided (only on the task initiating node).
 * <h2 class="header">Jboss AOP</h2>
 * The following configuration needs to be applied to enable JBoss byte code
 * weaving. Note that GridGain is not shipped with JBoss and necessary
 * libraries will have to be downloaded separately (they come standard
 * if you have JBoss installed already):
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 *      The following JVM configuration must be present:
 *      <ul>
 *      <li>`-javaagent:[path to jboss-aop-jdk50-4.x.x.jar]`</li>
 *      <li>`-Djboss.aop.class.path=[path to gridgain.jar]`</li>
 *      <li>`-Djboss.aop.exclude=org,com -Djboss.aop.include=org.gridgain.examples`</li>
 *      </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *      The following JARs should be in a classpath:
 *      <ul>
 *      <li>`javassist-3.x.x.jar`</li>
 *      <li>`jboss-aop-jdk50-4.x.x.jar`</li>
 *      <li>`jboss-aspect-library-jdk50-4.x.x.jar`</li>
 *      <li>`jboss-common-4.x.x.jar`</li>
 *      <li>`trove-1.0.2.jar`</li>
 *      </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <h2 class="header">AspectJ AOP</h2>
 * The following configuration needs to be applied to enable AspectJ byte code
 * weaving.
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 *      JVM configuration should include:
 *      `-javaagent:${GRIDGAIN_HOME}/libs/aspectjweaver-1.6.8.jar`
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *      Classpath should contain the `${GRIDGAIN_HOME}/config/aop/aspectj` folder.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
