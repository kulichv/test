/**
 * Distributed JUnit4 suite. It will execute all tests added to it
 * in parallel on the grid.
 * <p>
 * Note that since {@link TestA} and {@link TestB} are added to this
 * suite from within another nested suite and not directly, they will
 * always execute sequentially, however still in parallel with other
 * tests.
 * <p>
 * Also note, that since {@link TestC} is added as a part of local
 * suite (see {@link GridJunit4LocalSuite}), it will always execute
 * on local node, however still in parallel with other tests.
 * <p>
 * When starting remote nodes for test execution, make sure to point
 * them to {@code "$GRIDGAIN_HOME/config/junit/junit-spring.xml"}
 * configuration file.
