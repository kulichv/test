/**
 * Demonstrates a simple use of {@code @GridifySetToValue} and {@code GridifySetToSet} annotations.
 * <p>
 * Collection with numbers is passed as an argument to
 * {@link #findMaximum(Collection)} and to {@link #findPrimes(Iterable)} method.
 * Since this methods is annotated with appropriate annotation
 * ({@code @GridifySetToValue} and {@code GridifySetToSet}) it is
 * automatically grid-enabled and will be executed on few remote nodes.
 * Note, that the only thing user had to do is annotate method
 * with grid-enabled annotation, everything else is taken care of by the system.
 * <p>
 * <h1 class="header">Starting Remote Nodes</h1>
 * To try this example you should (but don't have to) start remote grid instances.
 * You can start as many as you like by executing the following script:
 * <pre class="snippet">{GRIDGAIN_HOME}/bin/ggstart.{bat|sh}</pre>
 * Once remote instances are started, you can execute this example from
 * Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans (and any other Java IDE) by simply hitting run
 * button. You will see that all nodes discover each other and
 * some of the nodes will participate in task execution (check node
 * output).
 * <p>
 * <h1 class="header">XML Configuration</h1>
 * If no specific configuration is provided, GridGain will start with
 * all defaults. For information about GridGain default configuration
 * refer to {@link GridFactory} documentation. If you would like to
 * try out different configurations you should pass a path to Spring
 * configuration file as 1st command line argument into this example.
 * The path can be relative to {@code GRIDGAIN_HOME} environment variable.
 * You should also pass the same configuration file to all other
 * grid nodes by executing startup script as follows (you will need
 * to change the actual file name):
 * <pre class="snippet">{GRIDGAIN_HOME}/bin/ggstart.{bat|sh} examples/config/specific-config-file.xml</pre>
 * <p>
 * GridGain examples come with multiple configuration files you can try.
 * All configuration files are located under {@code GRIDGAIN_HOME/examples/config}
 * folder. You are free to try any of these configurations, but whenever
 * using 3rd party configurations, such as JBoss JMS, ActiveMQ JMS, Sun MQ JMS, or GigaSpaces,
 * make sure to download these respective products and include all the necessary
 * libraries into classpath at node startup. All these libraries are already
 * specified in commented format in {@code GRIDGAIN_HOME/bin/setenv.{bat|sh}} files
 * which get executed automatically by GridGain startup scripts. You can simply
 * uncomment the necessary classpath portions as you need.
 * <p>
 * <h1 class="header">AOP Configuration</h1>
 * In order for this example to execute on the grid, any of the following
 * AOP configurations must be provided (only on the task initiating node).
 * <h2 class="header">Jboss AOP</h2>
 * The following configuration needs to be applied to enable JBoss byte code
 * weaving. Note that GridGain is not shipped with JBoss and necessary
 * libraries will have to be downloaded separately (they come standard
 * if you have JBoss installed already):
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 *      The following JVM configuration must be present:
 *      <ul>
 *      <li>{@code -javaagent:[path to jboss-aop-jdk50-4.x.x.jar]}</li>
 *      <li>{@code -Djboss.aop.class.path=[path to gridgain.jar]}</li>
 *      <li>{@code -Djboss.aop.exclude=org,com -Djboss.aop.include=org.gridgain.examples}</li>
 *      </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *      The following JARs should be in a classpath:
 *      <ul>
 *      <li>{@code javassist-3.x.x.jar}</li>
 *      <li>{@code jboss-aop-jdk50-4.x.x.jar}</li>
 *      <li>{@code jboss-aspect-library-jdk50-4.x.x.jar}</li>
 *      <li>{@code jboss-common-4.x.x.jar}</li>
 *      <li>{@code trove-1.0.2.jar}</li>
 *      </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <h2 class="header">AspectJ AOP</h2>
 * The following configuration needs to be applied to enable AspectJ byte code
 * weaving.
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 *      JVM configuration should include:
 *      {@code -javaagent:${GRIDGAIN_HOME}/libs/aspectjweaver-1.6.8.jar}
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *      Classpath should contain the {@code ${GRIDGAIN_HOME}/config/aop/aspectj} folder.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <h2 class="header">Spring AOP</h2>
 * Spring AOP framework is based on dynamic proxy implementation and doesn't require
 * any specific runtime parameters for online weaving. All weaving is on-demand and should
 * be performed by calling method {@link GridifySpringEnhancer#enhance(Object)} for the object
 * that has method with {@link Gridify} annotation.
 * <p>
 * Note that this method of weaving is rather inconvenient and AspectJ or JBoss AOP are
 * more recommended. Spring AOP can be used in situation when code augmentation is
 * undesired and cannot be used. It also allows for very fine grained control of what gets
 * weaved.
 * <p>
 * NOTE: this example as is cannot be used with Spring AOP. To see an example of grid-enabling
 * with Spring AOP refer to {@link GridifySpringMathematics}
 * example.
