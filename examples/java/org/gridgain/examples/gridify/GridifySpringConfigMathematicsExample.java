/**
 * Demonstrates a use of {@code @GridifySetToValue} and {@code GridifySetToSet} annotations with
 * Spring AOP configuration.
 * <p>
 * Collection with numbers is passed as an argument to
 * {@link GridifySpringAnnotatedMathematics#findMaximum(Collection)} and to
 * {@link GridifySpringAnnotatedMathematics#findPrimes(Iterable)} method.
 * Since this methods is annotated with appropriate annotation
 * ({@code @GridifySetToValue} and {@code GridifySetToSet}) it is
 * automatically grid-enabled and will be executed on few remote nodes.
 * Note, that the only thing user had to do is annotate method
 * with grid-enabled annotation, everything else is taken care of by the system.
 * <p>
 * <h1 class="header">Starting Remote Nodes</h1>
 * To try this example you should (but don't have to) start remote grid instances.
 * You can start as many as you like by executing the following script:
 * <pre class="snippet">{GRIDGAIN_HOME}/bin/ggstart.{bat|sh}</pre>
 * Once remote instances are started, you can execute this example from
 * Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans (and any other Java IDE) by simply hitting run
 * button. You will see that all nodes discover each other and
 * some of the nodes will participate in task execution (check node
 * output).
 * <p>
 * You should run the following sample with Spring XML configuration file shipped
 * with GridGain and located {@code ${GRIDGAIN_HOME}/examples/config/spring-aop-config.xml}.
 * You should pass a path to Spring XML configuration file as 1st command line
 * argument into this example.
 * <p>
 * NOTE: This example is slightly modified version of {@link GridifyMathematicsExample}
 * to make it work with Spring Framework AOP implementation.
 * <h1 class="header">Spring AOP</h1>
 * Spring AOP framework is based on dynamic proxy implementation and doesn't require
 * any specific runtime parameters for online weaving. All weaving is on-demand and should
 * be performed by calling method {@link GridifySpringEnhancer#enhance(Object)} for the object
 * that has method with {@link Gridify} annotation.
 * <p>
 * Note that this method of weaving is rather inconvenient and AspectJ or JbossAOP is
 * recommended over it. Spring AOP can be used in situation when code augmentation is
 * undesired and cannot be used. It also allows for very fine grained control of what gets
 * weaved.
