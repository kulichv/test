/**
 * Main bootstrap class for API-based Prime Number calculation on the grid. This
 * class starts up GridGain Grid and executes {@link GridPrimeTask} for
 * every number we want to check for prime.
 * <p>
 * Refer to {@link GridPrimeTask} for documentation on how prime numbers
 * are calculated.
 * <p>
 * <h1 class="header">Starting Remote Nodes</h1>
 * To try this example you should (but don't have to) start remote grid instances.
 * You can start as many as you like by executing the following script:
 * <pre class="snippet">{GRIDGAIN_HOME}/bin/ggstart.{bat|sh}</pre>
 * Once remote instances are started, you can execute this example from
 * Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans (and any other Java IDE) by simply hitting run
 * button. You will see that all nodes discover each other and
 * all of the nodes will participate in task execution (check node
 * output).
 * <p>
 * Note that when running this example on a multi-core box, simply
 * starting additional grid node on the same box will speed up
 * prime number calculation by a factor of 2.
 * <p>
 * <h1 class="header">XML Configuration</h1>
 * If no specific configuration is provided, GridGain will start with
 * all defaults. For information about GridGain default configuration
 * refer to {@link GridFactory} documentation. If you would like to
 * try out different configurations you should pass a path to Spring
 * configuration file as 1st command line argument into this example.
 * The path can be relative to {@code GRIDGAIN_HOME} environment variable.
 * You should also pass the same configuration file to all other
 * grid nodes by executing startup script as follows (you will need
 * to change the actual file name):
 * <pre class="snippet">{GRIDGAIN_HOME}/bin/ggstart.{bat|sh} examples/config/specific-config-file.xml</pre>
 * <p>
 * GridGain examples come with multiple configuration files you can try.
 * All configuration files are located under {@code GRIDGAIN_HOME/examples/config}
 * folder. You are free to try any of these configurations, but whenever
 * using 3rd party configurations, such as JBoss JMS, ActiveMQ JMS, Sun MQ JMS, or GigaSpaces,
 * make sure to download these respective products and include all the necessary
 * libraries into classpath at node startup. All these libraries are already
 * specified in commented format in {@code GRIDGAIN_HOME/bin/setenv.{bat|sh}} files
 * which get executed automatically by GridGain startup scripts. You can simply
 * uncomment the necessary classpath portions as you need.
