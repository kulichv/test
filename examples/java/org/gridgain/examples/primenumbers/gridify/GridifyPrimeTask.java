/**
 * Task responsible for checking passed in value for prime. It creates
 * as many jobs as there are nodes in the grid and sends this job to
 * grid nodes for execution (note, that local node also participates
 * in execution).
 * <p>
 * Every grid job gets a range of divisors to check. The lower and
 * upper boundaries of this range are passed into job as arguments.
 * The jobs invoke {@link GridPrimeChecker} to check if the value
 * passed in is divisible by any of the divisors in the range.
 * Refer to {@link GridPrimeChecker} for algorithm specifics (it is
 * very unsophisticated).
 * <p>
 * Upon receiving results from every job {@link #reduce(List)} method
 * is invoked. In this method we determine if any divisor was found.
 * If we found a divisor, then we know that a number is not a prime
 * number and there is no need to wait for other job results. In
 * this case, the method will return {@link GridJobResultPolicy#REDUCE}
 * policy in order to start aggregation of results. All remaining jobs
 * will be cancelled by the system. However, note that it is responsibility
 * of {@link GridPrimeChecker} to constantly check if it was cancelled
 * (via thread interruption) and abort when needed.
 * <p>
 * Aggregation of results happens in {@link #reduce(List)} method. In
 * this method we determine if any of the remote jobs returned a divisor.
 * If divisor is found, then we return it, otherwise we return {@code null}.
