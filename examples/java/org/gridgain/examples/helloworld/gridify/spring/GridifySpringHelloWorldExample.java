/**
 * Demonstrates a simple use of GridGain grid with
 * {@code Gridify} annotation and custom grid task by utilizing
 * Spring proxy-based AOP implementation.
 * <p>
 * String "Hello World" is set into {@link GridifySpringHelloWorld} instance
 * as its state. Since method {@link GridifySpringHelloWorld#sayIt()} is annotated
 * with {@code @Gridify} annotation it is automatically grid-enabled. The
 * {@link GridifySpringHelloWorldTask} task specified in {@link Gridify}
 * annotation will split the state of {@link GridifySpringHelloWorld} instance into
 * words and send each word as job argument for execution on separate nodes.
 * Jobs on remote nodes will create {@link GridifySpringHelloWorldImpl} instances and will
 * pre-initialize them with state passed in as job's argument. As an outcome,
 * two participating nodes will print out a single word from "Hello World"
 * string. One node will print out "Hello" and the other will print out
 * "World". If there is only one node participating, then it will
 * print out both words.
 * <p>
 * Grid task {@link GridifySpringHelloWorldTask} handles actual splitting
 * into sub-jobs, remote execution, and result reduction (see {@link GridTask}).
 * <p>
 * NOTE: This example is slightly modified version of {@link GridifyHelloWorldStateExample}
 * to make it work with Spring Framework AOP implementation.
 * <h1 class="header">Spring AOP</h1>
 * Spring AOP framework is based on dynamic proxy implementation and doesn't require
 * any specific runtime parameters for online weaving. All weaving is on-demand and should
 * be performed by calling method {@link GridifySpringEnhancer#enhance(Object)} for the object
 * that has method with {@link Gridify} annotation.
 * <p>
 * Note that this method of weaving is rather inconvenient and AspectJ or JbossAOP is
 * recommended over it. Spring AOP can be used in situation when code augmentation is
 * undesired and cannot be used. It also allows for very fine grained control of what gets
 * weaved.
 * <p>
 * <h1 class="header">Starting Remote Nodes</h1>
 * To try this example you should (but don't have to) start remote grid instances.
 * You can start as many as you like by executing the following script:
 * <pre class="snippet">{GRIDGAIN_HOME}/bin/ggstart.{bat|sh}</pre>
 * Once remote instances are started, you can execute this example from
 * Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans (and any other Java IDE) by simply hitting run
 * button. You will see that all nodes discover each other and
 * some of the nodes will participate in task execution (check node
 * output).
 * <p>
 * <h1 class="header">XML Configuration</h1>
 * If no specific configuration is provided, GridGain will start with
 * all defaults. For information about GridGain default configuration
 * refer to {@link GridFactory} documentation. If you would like to
 * try out different configurations you should pass a path to Spring
 * configuration file as 1st command line argument into this example.
 * The path can be relative to {@code GRIDGAIN_HOME} environment variable.
 * You should also pass the same configuration file to all other
 * grid nodes by executing startup script as follows (you will need
 * to change the actual file name):
 * <pre class="snippet">{GRIDGAIN_HOME}/bin/ggstart.{bat|sh} examples/config/specific-config-file.xml</pre>
 * <p>
 * GridGain examples come with multiple configuration files you can try.
 * All configuration files are located under {@code GRIDGAIN_HOME/examples/config}
 * folder. You are free to try any of these configurations, but whenever
 * using 3rd party configurations, such as JBoss JMS, ActiveMQ JMS, Sun MQ JMS, or GigaSpaces,
 * make sure to download these respective products and include all the necessary
 * libraries into classpath at node startup. All these libraries are already
 * specified in commented format in {@code GRIDGAIN_HOME/bin/setenv.{bat|sh}} files
 * which get executed automatically by GridGain startup scripts. You can simply
 * uncomment the necessary classpath portions as you need.
