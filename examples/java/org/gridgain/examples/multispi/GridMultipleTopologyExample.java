/**
 * Demonstrates a simple use of GridGain multiple topology SPI feature.
 * <p>
 * Two tasks {@link GridSegmentATask} and {@link GridSegmentBTask}
 * configured to be executed on certain nodes. {@link GridSegmentATask} should
 * be executed on nodes that have attribute {@code segment} with value {@code A}
 * and {@link GridSegmentBTask} should be executed on nodes that have attribute
 * {@code segment} with value {@code B}.
 * <p>
 * The node attributes are configured in {@code nodeA.xml} and {@code nodeB.xml}
 * files located in the same package. {@code NodeA} is configured with attribute
 * {@code segmentA}, and {@code NodeB} is configured with attribute {@code segmentB}.
 * <p>
 * The {@code master.xml} configuration represents the master node. It has two
 * Topology SPIs configured: one includes only nodes with {@code SegmentA} attribute
 * and the other includes only nodes with {@code SegmentB} attribute. The
 * {@link GridSegmentATask} and {@link GridSegmentBTask} tasks specify which Topology
 * SPI they should use via {@link GridTaskSpis} annotation. Once you run this example,
 * the master node with provided {@code master.xml} configuration will be started.
 * <p>
 * <h1 class="header">Starting Remote Nodes</h1>
 * To try this example you have to start two remote grid instances.
 * One should be started with configuration {@code nodeA.xml} that can be found
 * in the same package where example is. Another node should be started
 * with {@code nodeB.xml} configuration file. Here is an example of
 * starting node with {@code nodeA.xml} configuration file.
 * <pre class="snippet">{GRIDGAIN_HOME}/bin/ggstart.{bat|sh} /path_to_configuration/nodeA.xml</pre>
 * Once remote instances are started, you can execute this example from
 * Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans (and any other Java IDE) by simply hitting run
 * button. You will see that all nodes discover each other and
 * some of the nodes will participate in task execution (check node
 * output).
